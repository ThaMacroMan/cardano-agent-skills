[![Skills](https://img.shields.io/badge/skills-11-green.svg)](#available-skills)

A comprehensive set of **small, focused Agent Skills** for Cardano development. Self-calibrating, safe by design, and built for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and other AI coding assistants.

## Features

- **Self-calibrating**: Skills detect your installed CLI version and adapt commands automatically
- **Safe by design**: Risky operations require explicit human invocation
- **Least privilege**: Each skill has restricted tool access appropriate to its function
- **Token-efficient**: Compact frontmatter with progressive detail loading

## Quick Install

### Option A: Vercel Skills CLI
```bash
npx skills add Flux-Point-Studios/cardano-agent-skills
```

### Option B: add-skill (supports skill selection)
```bash
# Install all skills
npx add-skill Flux-Point-Studios/cardano-agent-skills -a claude-code

# Install specific skills only
npx add-skill Flux-Point-Studios/cardano-agent-skills --skill cardano-cli-wallets --skill cardano-cli-transactions -a claude-code
```

## Skill Design Principles

### 1. Self-Calibrating (Dynamic Context)

Skills that interact with CLI tools use dynamic context injection to adapt to your installed version:

```yaml
---
name: cardano-cli-doctor
context:
  - "!cardano-cli version"
  - "!cardano-cli --help | head -40"
  - "!cardano-cli conway --help 2>&1 | head -20"
---
```

This means the skill reads your actual CLI output before giving advice—no more hallucinated flags.

### 2. Safe by Design (Playbook + Operator Split)

Risky operations are split into two skills:

- **Playbook** (`cardano-cli-transactions`): Auto-discoverable, provides guidance, templates, and explanations. Cannot execute commands.
- **Operator** (`cardano-cli-transactions-operator`): Manual invoke only (`disable-model-invocation: true`). Can execute commands with explicit confirmation.

### 3. Least Privilege (Tool Restrictions)

Each skill declares exactly which tools it can use:

```yaml
---
name: cardano-cli-doctor
allowed-tools:
  - Bash(cardano-cli:*)
  - Bash(which:*)
  - Read
---
```

### 4. Token Efficiency

- Frontmatter `description` is always loaded (keep it tight)
- SKILL.md body loads when relevant
- Reference files load on demand
- Target: SKILL.md under 500 lines

## Version Compatibility

Skills are tested against:
- `cardano-cli` 10.x+ (Conway era, era-prefixed commands)
- `cardano-node` 10.x+
- `hydra-node` 0.20.x+
- `aiken` 1.1.x+

The `cardano-cli-doctor` skill will detect your version and recommend the appropriate command style.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Add/modify skills following the structure above
3. Ensure SKILL.md has valid frontmatter
4. Run validation: `npm run validate` (if available) or check CI
5. Submit PR

### Skill Naming Rules

- Lowercase with hyphens only
- Max 64 characters
- No reserved words (`claude`, `anthropic`, `skill`)
- Unique across the repo
